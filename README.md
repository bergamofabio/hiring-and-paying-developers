hiring-and-paying-developers
============================
Three questions to ask for an engineer before hiring him:
- What X do you use? (X = language, library, framework, etc)
- What compare to?
- Why pick this one?

Hirings timeline
- early stage: 3 programmers, not a CTO
- Series A ($3-5mm Rev): hire a CTO with experience of scaling up businesses (take a 5-people team to 50-100 people)

Compensation averages
- Project-based
-- Individuals: $125/h
-- Consulting shop: $225/h
- Salary: $90-150k/year
- Stocks: 0.5-3% participation, depending on the level of seniority and startup stage

*** Always try to pay programmers in a hourly base (vs. fixed rate) and require frequent releases / versions so that you build trust before hiring full time ***
